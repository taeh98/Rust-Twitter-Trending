The datafiles used were generated from the files full_who_dataset1.csv, full_who_dataset2.csv, and full_who_dataset3.csv from https://zenodo.org/record/3928240.
The original files were made by Fedor Vitiugin. The source file src/make_data_files.py was used to generate the out-n.csv data files from the original source files. It essentially takes unique tweets from them, shuffles them into a random order, and then puts them into the out-n.csv output data files.
